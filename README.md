ABOUT WEBSITE
I created a website using JavaScript and Firebase. Initially, I designed a login page using Firebase Authentication, where users can log in with their Gmail or Google accounts.
Additionally, users have the option to reset their passwords if needed.

Once logged in, users are redirected to the home.html page. This page features a navbar, where users can find a signout button and a "Shop" option.

Clicking on the "Shop" option enables users to add books to their cart and proceed to place orders.

Within the home.html page, there's a hero section. Inside this section, there's an "Add Book" button, allowing users to input details of a book. The data entered here is stored 
in Firebase Realtime Database.

Beneath the hero section, a search bar is provided, allowing users to search for any book. Additionally, various types of books are displayed below the search bar. 
This functionality is achieved by fetching data from the "Open Library" API.

Finally, the home page includes a footer for navigation and additional information.
